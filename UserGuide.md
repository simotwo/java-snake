_This wiki is for version 1.1 from [R5](https://code.google.com/p/java-snake/source/detail?r=5)._

# Introduction #

This wiki page is a user guide. The game is quite simple, but here's a reminder about how it works.


# Details #

## Controls ##
Here are the controls. You can't change them, sorry :

  * **UP**, **DOWN**, **LEFT**, **RIGHT** arrows : Control your snake
  * **SPACE** : Pause the game (resume by pressing any key)
  * **ESCAPE** : Exit the game
  * **F11** : Switch to/from a bigger frame

## Bonus ##

  * **Grey bonus** : A simple bonus that grows your snake by 1 (there's always one in the board).
  * **Green bonus** : Appears each 10 points you earn. They stay during 100 moves (approx 5 seconds) and grows your snake by 3

## Other ##

  * When you reach a game limit (window border), your snake will continue at the opposite side.
  * If your snake eats a part of himself, the game is over.
  * To start the game, launch **java -jar snake.jar** or with Windows you can simply double click on the file.
